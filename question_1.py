# Question 1(a)
# Create a program that calculates the area of the triangle

# area = (1/2) * base * height
base = float(input("Enter the base: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height: "))
area = (1/2) * base * height
print(f"The area of the triangle with base {base} and height {height} is {area}")
